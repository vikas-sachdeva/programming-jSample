Given an array of elements and change the array in such a way that all the elements on the array are distinct. 
If you are replacing a value, then the replacing value should be great than the previous value and after modification sum of the elements should be as less as possible.


Examples:

Input : arr = {1, 2, 2, 5, 8, 8, 8}
Output : 1 2 3 5 8 9 10
8 is replaced with 9 (A non-existing element greater than 8). 
Next duplicate occurrence of 8 is replaced with 10.

Input : arr = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7}
Output : 1 2 5 7 8 9 10

Input : arr = {9, 9, 9, 9, 9}
Output : 9 10 11 12 13
